# Mission // #001
## Solstice Rain
# Goals
- Land at Forward Operating Base Saber and await further orders.

# Mission Parameters
- Unknown at this time. Hostile forces are confirmed to be operating within Nov Elysia, so anticipate enemy contact; you are cleared to engage if fired upon.

# Stakes
- Failure to rendezvous at FOB Saber in a timely fashion will result in delays, setting the operation's timetable back and potentially narrowing the window of opportunity to rescue Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Reward
- Once the players arrive at FOB Saber, the situation on the ground will be evaluated and field upgrades distributed accordingly, bringing the PCs up to LL1. At his discretion, 1st Lt. Kim may also authorize the distribution of advanced weapons and systems as EXOTIC GEAR.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
